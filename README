These are some of the scripts I use to perform automatic QA checks 
on our Irish language software translations.  They are designed
to work on PO files.  

These were never meant for other humans' eyes, so forgive the
terrible coding style throughout.  I'm putting them here at the urging
of Mozilla's l10n drivers in case there are some ideas that could
be mined for more general QA checks across a number of locales.

I think they should run without requiring many changes on any standard
Linux system.  You may need to install a few Perl modules, e.g.
Locale::PO, HOP::Lexer, and Lingua::GA::Gramadoir.

There is a hard-coded path in several scripts pointing to the directory
where all of this is cloned on my machine (currently /home/kps/seal/l10n-qa) -
you'll want to change those paths.   At some point I may add a makefile
with install targets, etc.  Assuming you set all this up, the scripts
can be run as follows:

$ bash cpo.sh a.po b.po ...

I added some English comments to the cpo.sh script enumerating
and briefly describing the various checks that happen.  The messages
output to users are usually in Irish.
